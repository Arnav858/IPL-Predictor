## Project Overview
The IPL Score Predictor is a machine learning model designed to predict the final score of a team in an IPL match after 20 overs. The model uses historical IPL match data to make predictions based on key factors such as wickets fallen and runs scored in the last 5 overs.

## Features
- Predicts the final score after 20 overs based on match conditions.
- Uses past team scores from IPL matches (2008-2019) for training.
- Considers runs and wickets in the last 5 overs as key input features.
- Built using machine learning techniques for regression.

## Dataset
The dataset contains past team scores for each IPL match from 2008 to 2019, with data points including:
- Runs scored per ball.
- Wickets fallen.
- Total score at the end of the innings.
